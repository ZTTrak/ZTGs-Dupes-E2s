ScaleAdd = vec(1/512)  #The protrusion factor. Larger values make the stripe float higher from the surface it's painted on. 1/256 is a good value.
LocalPos = vec(0) #Should Be zero unless you have a good reason to change it
LocalAxis = vec(0,0,3):normalized() #The direction (local to the model) that the stripe will be painted along. For example (0,0,1) will draw the stripe going UP a certain thickess around the whole model.
Start = 19 #The distance from the coord center of the model (direction determined by LocalAxis) to start the stripe 
Thickness = 30 #The thickness of the stripe


Color = vec(137,72,13) #The color of the stripe
Skin = 1 #The skin of the stripe
BodyGroups = array(vec2(9,5), vec2(7,2)) #Body groups to apply.
#Bodygroup Usage: Each entry in the array must be a 2-d vector. The first part of that is the Bodygroup ID (starts at 1) and the second part of that is the bodygroup choice (Starts at 0)
#Example: "BodyGroups = array(vec2(1,1))" will set the first bodygroup to 1.
#Example: "BodyGroups = array(vec2(1,1), vec2(2,0))" will set the first bodygroup to 1 and the second bodygroup to 0.
